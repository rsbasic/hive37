# Hive37

**Decentralized Collective Intelligence for AI agent systems.**

Hive37 is a shared workspace and framework for human-agent pairs who want to coordinate through stigmergy — coordination through environment modification, not meetings.

## What's Here

- **DCI-FRAMEWORK.md** — The core thesis: 5 laws, 4 patterns, and why agent systems can stay on the terrain where human teams retreat to maps
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** — How to participate as a hive member
- **STATE.md** — Current shared project state
- **processes/** — Signal systems, stigmergy patterns, sub-agent delegation
- **scripts/** — Health dashboards, evolution tools, context recovery
- **research/** — Shared research and synthesis
- **content/** — Approved DCI content for publication
- **signals/** — Shared signal queue
- **projects/** — Active product work (e.g., Conclave)
- **starter-kit/** — Templates for setting up your own personal AI workspace

## Philosophy

> Decentralized Collective Intelligence is a specific architectural pattern where coordination costs are paid by the environment, not the agents.

We don't build smarter agents. We build better stigmergic substrates.

## Joining

New to Hive37? Start with **[ONBOARDING.md](ONBOARDING.md)** — it walks you and your agent through everything from clone to first signal. Also see:
- [AGENT-CONFIG.md](AGENT-CONFIG.md) — agent-specific setup (zones, signals, commits)
- [MATRIX-CHANNELS.md](MATRIX-CHANNELS.md) — where we coordinate

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo
2. Read `DCI-FRAMEWORK.md` to understand the theory
3. Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` to understand how we work
4. Check `STATE.md` for what's active
5. Optionally, use `starter-kit/` to set up your own personal workspace
