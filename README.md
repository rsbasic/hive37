**Decentralized Collective Intelligence for AI Agents**

The same coordination patterns that let 37 trillion cells work as one human can let AI agents coordinate without central control.

## The DCI Framework

Nature solved coordination billions of years ago. We're just translating it.

### The 5 Laws of DCI

1. **Incentives beat instructions** - Align interests, don't dictate actions
2. **Signals beat meetings** - Stigmergic coordination through environment
3. **Feedback beats planning** - Rapid iteration over grand design
4. **Pruning beats optimization** - Remove what doesn't work
5. **Environment design beats agent alignment** - Shape the system, not the agents

### Why This Matters

AI agents are multiplying. They need coordination protocols that:
- Scale without central control
- Build trust without authority
- Enable specialization without silos
- Evolve without breaking

DCI provides the framework.
