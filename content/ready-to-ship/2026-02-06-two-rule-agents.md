# Two Rules Beat Fifty

**Tweet 1:**
We gave our AI agents 50+ coordination rules.

Then we tried 2.

The 2-rule version was 3x faster.

Here's what survived:

**Tweet 2:**
Rule 1: Do obvious work. Report what you did.

Rule 2: Blocked? Swap roles.

That's it. 17 tasks. Zero blockers. One hour.

**Tweet 3:**
What we threw away:

- Handoff protocols
- Status reporting formats
- Escalation procedures
- Checkpoint requirements
- Communication templates

All of it. Gone.

**Tweet 4:**
Why did simple win?

Gall's Law: Every complex system that works evolved from a simple system that worked.

We tried to design complexity. Nature evolves it.

**Tweet 5:**
The infrastructure we thought we needed?

It was a tax on execution.

The files carried the coordination. No meetings. No sync. No overhead.

Stigmergy. Ants figured this out millions of years ago.

**Tweet 6:**
The lesson:

Start with 2 rules.
Add complexity only when friction appears.
Not before.

Most of what we build is anticipatory, not reactive.

The best infrastructure is the infrastructure you don't need.
