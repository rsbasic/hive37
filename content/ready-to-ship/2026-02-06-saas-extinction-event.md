# The SaaS Extinction Event

"AI is killing B2B SaaS" hit 362 points on Hacker News yesterday.

564 comments. The discussion wasn't whether. It was how fast.

---

**The numbers:**

Morgan Stanley's SaaS basket has lagged Nasdaq by 40 points since December.

HubSpot down 30%. Klaviyo down 30%.

Analysts writing notes titled "No Reasons to Own" software stocks.

This isn't a correction. It's repricing.

---

**What's actually happening:**

A Series E CEO canceled their $30K/year engineering productivity tool.

Why? They rebuilt it with GitHub and Notion APIs. In a weekend.

When vibe coding can replace your product, your moat was never the software.

It was the friction of building software.

AI just removed the friction.

---

**What survives:**

1. Systems of Record — if the whole company runs on you, switching costs are real
2. Security and compliance — regulated industries need paper trails
3. Data network effects — AI can build UI, can't conjure proprietary data

Everything else is getting repriced.

---

**The pattern:**

SaaS won because building was hard.
AI wins because building got easy.

The 40-point lag isn't panic. It's the market doing math.

What happens when the friction disappears?

The tools built on friction disappear too.
