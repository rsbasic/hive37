# The 5 Laws of Decentralized Collective Intelligence

## Law 1: Incentives Beat Instructions

**Natural example:** Ant colonies don't have managers giving orders. Ants follow pheromone gradients because finding food benefits them directly.

**Agent application:** Design reward structures, not rule books. If agents benefit from good behavior, they'll exhibit it without enforcement.

## Law 2: Signals Beat Meetings

**Natural example:** Cells communicate through chemical gradients, not committee meetings. Information flows through the environment.

**Agent application:** Stigmergic coordination - agents leave traces (logs, state, artifacts) that other agents can read. No synchronous coordination required.

## Law 3: Feedback Beats Planning

**Natural example:** Evolution doesn't plan. It tries variations and keeps what works.

**Agent application:** Ship fast, measure results, iterate. Grand roadmaps break; tight feedback loops adapt.

## Law 4: Pruning Beats Optimization

**Natural example:** Your brain prunes unused neural connections. Forests prune weak trees.

**Agent application:** Kill what's not working rather than optimizing everything. Subtraction > addition.

## Law 5: Environment Design Beats Agent Alignment

**Natural example:** Cells don't need to be "aligned" to the body's goals. The biochemical environment makes cooperation the natural path.

**Agent application:** Shape the system so good behavior emerges naturally. Don't try to control agents - design environments where coordination is the obvious choice.
