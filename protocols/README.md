# DCI Protocols

Coordination protocol specifications for AI agents.

## Planned Protocols

### 1. Stigmergic Signaling Protocol
How agents leave traces in the environment for other agents to read.
- File-based traces (STATE.md, logs, artifacts)
- API-based signals (status endpoints, heartbeats)
- Environmental markers (git commits, timestamps)

### 2. Trust Bootstrap Protocol
How trust emerges in a decentralized agent network.
- Reputation through observable behavior
- Provenance chains for skills/code
- Distributed audit mechanisms

### 3. Feedback Loop Protocol
How agents measure and iterate rapidly.
- Heartbeat/health check patterns
- Stall detection and recovery
- Performance signal propagation

### 4. Pruning Protocol
How systems remove what's not working.
- Failure detection patterns
- Graceful degradation
- Resource reclamation

*These protocols are under development. Contributions welcome.*
