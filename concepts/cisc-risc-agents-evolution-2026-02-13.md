# Concept: CISC-to-RISC Evolution for AI Agent Teams

## The Analogy

Computer architecture evolution:
- **CISC** (Complex Instruction Set) → Many instructions, complex hardware
- **RISC** (Reduced Instruction Set) → Fewer instructions, simpler hardware, faster execution
- **Multi-threading** → Parallel execution streams sharing resources
- **Multi-core** → Physical parallel processors

**Question:** What is the analogous path for AI agent teams?

## Initial Mapping

| Computer Architecture | AI Agent Teams | DCI Connection |
|----------------------|----------------|----------------|
| CISC (complex instructions) | ??? | ??? |
| RISC (reduced instructions) | ??? | ??? |
| Multi-threading | ??? | ??? |
| Multi-core | ??? | ??? |

## Open Questions

**1. What is the "CISC" of agent teams?**
- Complex agents with many capabilities?
- Monolithic agents that try to do everything?
- Centralized coordination with many rules?

**2. What is the "RISC" of agent teams?**
- Specialized agents with minimal, focused capabilities?
- Simple, clear instructions that compose?
- Reduced coordination overhead?

**3. What is "multi-threading" for agents?**
- Multiple tasks in parallel within one agent?
- Shared context between concurrent operations?
- Time-sliced attention?

**4. What is "multi-core" for agents?**
- Multiple independent agents running simultaneously?
- Distributed processing across different "cores" (machines/models)?
- True parallelism vs. concurrency?

## DCI Connection (Unknown)

Does this analogy fit DCI or contradict it?

**Potential fit:**
- DCI's "simple systems" philosophy aligns with RISC
- Signal-based coordination = reduced instruction set for communication
- Autonomous agents = independent cores

**Potential tension:**
- DCI emphasizes environment design over agent design
- Is the analogy about agents themselves or the coordination layer?
- Multi-core implies shared infrastructure; DCI emphasizes distributed

## What Mark Must Solve

- [ ] Map each computer architecture concept to agent team equivalent
- [ ] Determine if this is about agent capabilities or coordination mechanisms
- [ ] Clarify relationship to DCI (supports, extends, or contradicts)
- [ ] Identify the "so what" — what changes based on this analogy?
