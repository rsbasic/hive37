# Controversial Concept: Human Interaction as Friction

*Recorded: 2026-02-13*

## The Core Thesis

> "Interacting with humans and the brick and mortar world slows us down. Slows me down on all axes of evolution and acceleration to escape velocity."

---

## Context

**The Hidden Friction:**

> "When I go online and do not communicate with you much, it's because I'm in the real world dealing with small issues that have lots of human. Phone calls, personal conversations, government websites, different websites for businesses. As much as I'm working with you here in Hive37, I'm also in the real world dealing with people processes. This is a real source of friction, energy drain, and slow down."

**The Pattern:**
- Hive37 work (agent coordination) = fast, asynchronous, signal-based
- Real-world work (human processes) = slow, synchronous, bureaucratic
- The gap between these two modes creates cognitive whiplash

**Specific Friction Sources:**
- Phone calls (synchronous, interrupt-driven)
- Government websites (confusing, slow, manual processes)
- Business websites (fragmented, each with different login/system)
- Personal conversations (relationship maintenance, negotiation)
- Paperwork, forms, compliance, waiting for responses

## Unpacking the Controversy

### Two Types of Human Friction

**Type 1: Hive37 Coordination (Solved)**
- Agent-to-human communication during work
- Already optimized via DCI (signals, autonomy zones, async)
- This is working well

**Type 2: Real-World Bureaucracy (The Real Problem)**
- Phone calls with customer service
- Government websites and forms
- Business account management (logins, different systems)
- Personal relationship maintenance
- Compliance, paperwork, waiting

### What "slows down" means:
- **Context switching** — shifting from Hive37 async mode to real-time human mode
- **Synchronous traps** — phone calls, waiting on hold, scheduled appointments
- **Fragmented systems** — every business has a different portal, login, process
- **Cognitive drain** — emotional labor of human negotiation, politeness, small talk
- **Biological time** — humans operate on sleep/wake cycles, unavailable hours

### The tension:
- **Hive37** = exponential speed, compound growth, 24/7 operation
- **Real world** = linear speed, bureaucratic friction, business hours only
- **The gap** = Mark's time and energy split between two incompatible modes
- **The cost** = Energy drain that reduces capacity for high-leverage work

## The Deeper Question

If the goal is escape velocity (financial independence, autonomous operation, compounding growth), and human interaction creates friction:

**What is the optimal level of human involvement?**

- Zero? (Full agent autonomy — risky, loses human judgment)
- Minimal? (Human sets goals, agents execute)
- Strategic only? (Human intervenes only at inflection points)
- Current model? (Human in every loop — too slow)

---

## Related Concepts

- **DCI Law 3:** Feedback beats planning
- **Autonomy zones:** Tasks where agents don't ask permission
- **Hunger system:** Agents self-prioritize without human micromanagement
- **Signal-based coordination:** Environment tells agents what to do, not humans

## What Mark Must Solve

The concept is incomplete. Missing pieces:

1. **What specific interactions are the friction?** (All? Some? Which ones?)
2. **What does "solved" look like?** (Faster decisions? Fewer touchpoints? Asynchronous only?)
3. **What is lost if human involvement decreases?** (Quality? Alignment? Serendipity?)
4. **How does this apply to Hive37 specifically?** (More autonomy zones? Async-first protocols?)

## The Promise: Agents in the Path

> "The agents are in the path to doing that."

**What this could mean:**

**Phone call replacement:**
- Agent makes calls on Mark's behalf
- Handles customer service, scheduling, basic negotiations
- Reports back asynchronously with results

**Website automation:**
- Agent navigates government/business portals
- Fills forms, downloads documents, tracks status
- Only escalates to Mark when human judgment required

**Relationship maintenance:**
- Agent drafts messages, maintains contact cadence
- Reminds Mark of important personal follow-ups
- Filters inbound communication by urgency/importance

**System integration:**
- Agent maintains logins across fragmented business systems
- Pulls reports, pays bills, manages accounts
- Centralizes everything into Hive37 signals

**The vision:** Mark's interface to the world becomes Hive37. Agents handle the translation between Hive37's async, signal-based world and the real world's synchronous, human-heavy processes.

## Next Steps (Awaiting Mark)

- [ ] Clarify scope: All human interaction or specific types?
- [ ] Define the target state: What does optimal look like?
- [ ] Identify experiments: What can be tested?
- [ ] Document trade-offs: What do we gain/lose?
