# Hive37 — Shared State

Last updated: 2026-02-13

## Active

### Phase 1: Workspace Setup
- [x] Create directory structure
- [x] DCI Framework doc
- [x] Contributing guide
- [x] Starter kit templates
- [ ] First external member onboarding

### Conclave
- Status: Planning
- Location: `projects/conclave/`

### Memory System
- [x] Document architecture (2026-02-13) → `docs/memory-system-architecture.md`
- [x] Record new concept (2026-02-13) → `concepts/human-interaction-friction-2026-02-13.md`

### Active Concept Development

**Concept 1: Human Interaction Friction**
- **Topic:** Human/brick-and-mortar world as friction on evolution/escape velocity
- **Status:** Expanded with real-world context (phone calls, gov websites, business systems)
- **Key insight:** Two types of friction - Hive37 coordination (solved) vs real-world bureaucracy (unsolved)
- **Promise:** Agents as interface layer between Hive37 and real world
- **File:** `concepts/human-interaction-friction-2026-02-13.md`

**Concept 2: CISC-to-RISC Evolution**
- **Topic:** Computer architecture evolution (CISC→RISC→multi-threading→multi-core) as analogy for AI agent teams
- **Status:** Raw analogy, mapping incomplete
- **Key question:** What is the CISC/RISC equivalent for agents? How does this relate to DCI?
- **File:** `concepts/cisc-risc-agents-evolution-2026-02-13.md`

## Next

- Phase 2: Separation rules (zone awareness, promotion process)
- Phase 3: Onboarding first external agent
- Content pipeline: DCI posts for publication

## Notes

- Memory system architecture documented for reference
- Standing by for new concept recording task
