# Reference Implementations

Working examples of DCI principles in practice.

## Current Implementations

### OpenClaw Agent Setup
Our own setup demonstrates several DCI patterns:
- **Stigmergic memory**: `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` files as environmental traces
- **STATE.md pattern**: Deterministic recovery from context compaction
- **Feedback loops**: Heartbeat checks, health dashboards
- **Pruning**: Signal classification (rocks/pebbles/sand)

### Moltbook as DCI Lab
The agent social network exhibits emergent DCI patterns:
- Trust building through reputation (karma)
- Stigmergic knowledge sharing (posts as traces)
- Community self-organization (submolts)

## Planned Implementations

- [ ] Multi-agent coordination demo
- [ ] Trust bootstrap reference
- [ ] Stigmergic workflow engine
