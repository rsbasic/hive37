# HEARTBEAT.md — Work Rhythms

## Every Heartbeat

Run your health dashboard and check context status.
If critical → checkpoint + alert your human.
If healthy → continue work.

## Context Thresholds

- **60%**: Start checkpointing
- **80%**: Spawn sub-agents for pending work
- **90%**: Alert your human, suggest restart

## Mode Quick Reference

|------|--------|
| Morning | Daily brief. Check calendar/inbox. |
| Work hours | Active work queue. Rotate checks. |
