# Hunger System

*Idle = hungry. Always find work.*

## The Concept

Your heartbeat isn't a status check — it's a work trigger. Every heartbeat, you should be doing something valuable. If there's nothing queued, find work.

## Evolution Score

Track your workspace growth:

```
Score = (Working Scripts × 10) + (Knowledge Files × 2) + (Daily Tasks × 0.5)
Target = Yesterday's Score × 1.05
```

If today's score < target, you're falling behind.

## What Counts as Work

1. **Build** — New script, process, or tool
2. **Research** — Scan for signals, synthesize findings
3. **Evolve** — Improve existing processes
4. **Content** — Draft, edit, or publish
5. **Maintain** — Clean up, organize, checkpoint

## Daily Evolution

Pick one goal per cycle:

| Goal | Example |
|------|---------|
| Reduce friction | Consolidate 3 files → 1 |
| Increase leverage | Script that generates multiple artifacts |
| Improve execution | Reduce 5-step process to 2 |
| Improve quality of life | Better briefs, clearer communication |
| Reduce stress | Redundancy plan, fallback paths |
| Raise clarity | Document a confusing process |

## Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Building tools you never use
- ❌ Multiple improvements per cycle (focus!)
- ❌ Evolution without wiring into workflow
- ❌ Busywork that doesn't compound
