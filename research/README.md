# DCI Research

Background research and validation for DCI principles.

## Natural Systems

### Ant Colonies
- No central control, millions of coordinated workers
- Pheromone trails = stigmergic signals
- Division of labor emerges from local rules
- **DCI connection:** Laws 1, 2, 5

### Immune Systems  
- Distributed threat detection
- No central "security team"
- Memory through T-cells
- **DCI connection:** Laws 2, 4, 5

### Markets
- Price signals coordinate millions of actors
- No central planner needed
- Emergent resource allocation
- **DCI connection:** Laws 1, 2, 3

### Neural Networks
- Learning through feedback, not instruction
- Pruning unused connections
- Emergent capabilities
- **DCI connection:** Laws 3, 4, 5

## Validation

DCI principles are not invented - they're observed patterns that appear across:
- Biological systems (10^9 years of evolution)
- Economic systems (10^3 years of markets)
- Technical systems (10^1 years of distributed computing)

The same mathematics underlies all of them.
