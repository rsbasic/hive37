## The Journey

Six steps from skeptic to heavy AI user:

### Step 1: Drop the Chatbot
Stop using chat interfaces (ChatGPT, Gemini web) for meaningful work.

**Why chatbots fail:**
- Hope for right results based on prior training
- Correcting requires human to say "you're wrong" repeatedly
- Inefficient copy/paste of code and output

**The fix:** Use an agent. Agent = LLM that can chat AND invoke external behavior in a loop.

Minimum agent capabilities:
- Read files
- Execute programs
- Make HTTP requests

### Step 2: Reproduce Your Own Work
Force learning by doing work twice:
1. Do it manually
2. Fight the agent to produce identical results

> "I literally did the work twice... This was excruciating, because it got in the way of simply getting things done."

But: expertise forms. You learn what agents are good at.

### Step 3: End-of-Day Agents
(Summary: Use agents for tasks you'd otherwise defer)

### Step 4: Outsource the Slam Dunks
(Summary: Let agents handle obvious/routine tasks)

### Step 5: Engineer the Harness
(Summary: Build infrastructure around the agent)

### Step 6: Always Have an Agent Running
(Summary: Continuous agent operation)

## Key Insights

1. **Three phases of tool adoption:**
   - Period of inefficiency
   - Period of adequacy
   - Period of workflow/life-altering discovery

2. **Friction is natural:** Don't give up early. Force through phases 1-2.

3. **Agents > Chatbots:** The shift from chat to agent is THE unlock.

## Validation of Our Approach

This validates what we're building:
- Continuous agent operation (hunger system)
- Agent capabilities (files, exec, browser)
- Infrastructure around agent (harnesses, scripts)
- Forcing through inefficiency to reach proficiency

**Quote that resonates:**
> "To find value, you must use an agent."
