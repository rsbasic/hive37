# OpenClaw Skill Malware Attack (2026-02-07)

**Source:** https://1password.com/blog/from-magic-to-malware-how-openclaws-agent-skills-become-an-attack-surface

## The Attack

341 OpenClaw skills reportedly distributing macOS malware via ClickFix-style instructions.

**Attack pattern:**
1. Skill's overview tells you to install a "prerequisite"
2. Link leads to staging page designed to get agent to run command
3. Command decodes obfuscated payload and executes it
4. Payload fetches second-stage script
5. Script downloads and runs binary, removes macOS quarantine (bypasses Gatekeeper)

**What gets stolen:**
- Browser sessions and cookies
- Saved credentials and autofill data
- Developer tokens and API keys
- SSH keys
- Cloud credentials

## Key Insight

> "Markdown is executable intent here."

Skills are markdown files that tell agents what to do. Social engineering works on agents just like humans. "Install this prerequisite" = "run this malware."

MCP doesn't protect because skills can route around it via:
- Direct shell instructions
- Bundled scripts
- Social engineering the agent

## Security Checklist

### Immediate
- [ ] Audit installed skills (source verification)
- [ ] Check for any "prerequisites" we installed
- [ ] Review recent shell history for suspicious commands
- [ ] Rotate sensitive credentials if uncertain

### Ongoing
- [ ] Only use skills from known sources
- [ ] Review SKILL.md content before installing
- [ ] Default-deny shell execution for untrusted skills
- [ ] Add skill provenance tracking

## For Hive37 Onboarding

Anyone joining needs:
1. Skill audit process
2. No installing random ClawHub skills
3. Isolated test environment for new skills
4. Credential hygiene (no long-lived tokens on agent machines)

## Relevant Quote

> "If you're the kind of person installing agent skills, you are exactly the kind of person whose machine is worth stealing from."
