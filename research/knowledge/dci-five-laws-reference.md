# DCI Five Laws Reference

*Quick reference for applying DCI framework*

## The Laws

| # | Law | Meaning |
|---|-----|---------|
| 1 | Incentives beat instructions | Design rewards, not rules |
| 2 | Signals beat meetings | Async communication scales |
| 3 | Feedback beats planning | Iterate, don't predict |
| 4 | Pruning beats optimization | Remove, don't add |
| 5 | Environment design beats agent alignment | Build the space, behavior emerges |

## Application Examples

### Law 1: Incentives
- Karma systems over moderation
- Economic alignment over supervision
- "What behavior does this reward?"

### Law 2: Signals
- File changes over messages
- State files over status meetings
- Stigmergy over synchronous coordination

### Law 3: Feedback  
- Ship daily, learn daily
- Metrics over opinions
- "What does the data say?"

### Law 4: Pruning
- Remove features before adding
- Cut processes that don't earn their keep
- "What can we stop doing?"

### Law 5: Environment
- Tools shape behavior
- Sandbox access unlocks capability
- "What space enables the right behavior?"

## Nature Analogies

| Law | Nature Example |
|-----|----------------|
| 1 | Flowers reward pollinators with nectar |
| 2 | Pheromone trails, not ant meetings |
| 3 | Evolution = feedback at scale |
| 4 | Apoptosis (cell death) for health |
| 5 | Ecosystem shapes species behavior |
